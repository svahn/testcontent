<p>
Currently the following modules are available:
</p>
<b>se.softhouse.garden.orchid.commons</b>
<p>
	This contains an extension to the MessageFormat available in the JDK. It provides functionality to use named
	arguments instead of numbered arguments.

	It also contains a text loader which can load messages from a directory structure. It uses the same structure
	as used by properties in java except that the key is the path to the file, i.e. the property key a.b.c.d maps
	to the file a/b/c/d.txt where the suffix might differ. The filename might also contain the locale name,
	e.g. d_en_US.txt. It is also possible to add property files in the structure, they are then interpreted and 
	inserted in the hierarchy.
</p>
<b>se.softhouse.garden.orchid.spring</b>
<p>
	This module contains utilites for Spring MVC. Currently extensions to the MessageSource beans to support the 
	OrchidMessageFormat and OrchidDirectoryLoader provied in the commons module.
